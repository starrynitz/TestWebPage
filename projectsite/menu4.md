#  Projection Flow

## Projection Flow

1. Iterate through selected runs based on run settings
2. Iterate through selected products based on general settings
3. For each product:
   - Read all model points into DataFrame
   - Load product feature set
   - Load assumption sets for base projection and reserving and capital requirement inner projections
4. For each model point:
   - Load the model point
   - Project policy information tables
   - Project assumptions tables based on base projection assumption set
   - Project Per Policy Table with product feature set
   - Project Per Policy Table with assumption tables
   - Project survivalship
   - Project in force cash flow before reserve and capital requirement
   - Project present value of in force cash flow before reserve and capital requirement
   - Project reserve per policy based on reserving assumption set
   - Project capital requirement per policy based on capital requirement assumption set
   - Project in force cash flow and present value for and after increase in reserve and capital requirement
